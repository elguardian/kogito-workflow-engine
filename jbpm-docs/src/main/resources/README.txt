The diagrams were made with the community version of SQL Power*Architect. 

The database schema's which the diagrams were reverse engineered from, 
were from a postgresql database that was generated via the jbpm-installer 
demo. 

Once the diagrams had been generated and prettied up, a PDF was generated. 

GIMP was then used to generate a JPEG file from the PDF.
